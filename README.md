# Weekend Challenge 5 - Real Estate Application

Welcome to my weekend challenge #5 application.  This application allows a user to take on the role of a developer for a real estate company. Inside of it, you will find information for properties that are either "for rent" or "for sale". Also included is an option to sort properties by type, and add new listings.


## Week 5 Prime Academy Project Requirements

- [ ] Create a Full Stack application from the ground up using Angular, Node, and MongoDB
- [ ] Work with the data set that we have provided for you
- [ ] Use Bootstrap/Angular Materials to present the data
- [ ] Account for the different data ("rent" versus "cost") and ensure that this is noted on the display of the information, by listing "For Rent" or "For Sale" based on which of the two properties that it has.
- [ ] User `angular-route` to display the data in multiple views.
- [ ] Interact with the server via an Angular service. 

## Notes
- Technologies used include mongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, AngularJS, Angular Materials, and CSS3/HTML5.
